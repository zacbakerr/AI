This second back propagation lab takes a single argument, an inequality related to a circle, in the form of "x*x+y*y<1.1" where the less than may be any one of <, <=, >, or >= and the 1.1 may be any real in [.8,1.2].  The submitted script is to construct a neural network according to the same standards as in the first back propagation lab, and to output that NN.

The NN that the submitted script is to determine takes either two arguments, x and y, or three, if a bias is to be included.  There is one single output which is whether (x,y) satisfies the inequality that the script is given.  x and y are guaranteed to be in [-1.5, 1.5].  The submitted script has 100 seconds to determine a neural net.  It may output more than one, the most recent one is the one that the grader will evaluate.  Timing out is OK.

When the grader receives the neural net that the submitted script output, it will construct the NN internally and throw 100000 random points (within the above bounding box) at the NN and determine whether the NN classifies the point correctly.  If the NN outputs a .5 or greater, it is construed to mean that the NN is claiming that the inequality is satisfied.  Less than .5 implies that the NN has determined that the point does not satisfy the inequality.  The grader will never test with a point that is exactly on the circle.

The aim is for the NN to classify 99+% of the points thrown at it correctly.
